[Question]\n(8) Seeker: more for the situation in general . i know we will not speak but we will constantly be running into each other , my house is not big . and i have no car to escape it .\n(9) Supporter: It ' s like we live the same life . I also have no car to escape ! It seems so small , but it ' s such a huge stressor when you feel trapped in an environment you ' re not positive in . I feel your pain and I empathize with you completely . . It ' ll be hard but I hope you can make it through it throughout the holidays and enjoy yourself some . Are there any pros to going back home ? Any pets ? [Self-disclosure]\n(10) Seeker: Thank you I appreciate that . I will be fine making it over the thanksgiving break but I am more nervous about covid - 19 sending us home for good . . Not many to be honest . I have a hamster but he is at school with me so nothing at home to go back to .\n(11) Supporter: It sounds like Covid - 19 is going to be a personal stressor for you . It ' s such a strange thing to have to live with already , the pandemic , and i ' m sorry that it might end up pushing you where you don ' t want to be . Could you bring your hamster home with you ? Even the smallest things could help a place feel more loving . [Restatement or Paraphrasing]\n(12) Seeker: Yes it is very strange and I know that it is a big stressor on all of us , i don ' t want to sound selfish . . Yes i am bringing him home with me so that is my little piece of joy that is coming along .\n(13) Supporter: I don ' t think you ' re selfish at all . You have feelings you are entitled to have and are expressing them which is healthy and I encourage that behavior ! Good ! I know how hard this situation can be . Very nerve wracking . The smallest things , even a hamster , can be so beneficial . [Affirmation and Reassurance]\n(14) Seeker: Well thank you that does help me to feel better . Yes I am happy to bring him home with me and hoping I can have my niece over to intro duce her to him .\n(15) Supporter: You sound like a very determined person in making this trip as stress free as possible . I commend you for that ! Maybe you could have your niece over often to play with your hamster just to soften the stress of being there . [Reflection of feelings]\n(16) Seeker: It is surely my goal ! I appreciate your kind words . I would love that if I had a car I could do that but I am not sure how much she will be able to come to my house . I am going to try though !\n(17) Supporter: Is Uber an option for you ? I know there ' s a lot of rideshare services but they ' re not always financially reasonable . But that could be a way to get away if you ever need too ! [Providing Suggestions or Information]\n(18) Seeker: that is very true i didn ' t even think of that to be honest ! I may use that along the way , thank you for the reminder !\n(19) Supporter: Sometimes I forget little things like that to help myself whenever I get too involved in the emotional aspect of things .

Well personally , when I was going through a hard time and I felt like I didn ' t have any friends , I found a couple pretty cool apps that helped me out ! IT sounds crazy , but there are apps specifically for finding friends . They are kind of like dating apps but it ' s 100 % meant for friends so everyone on them has the same intentions you do . I actually found a couple close friends through apps like that . Have you heard about those or looked into them ? [Self-disclosure]\n(8) Seeker: I ' ve never heard of friendship apps to be honest .\n(9) Supporter: Yeah ! They are a really good way to connect with people that you share a lot of similar interests with . . But it sounds to me that you are pretty overall sad right now .

[Providing Suggestions or Information]\n(10) Seeker: I ' d really like someone local though , someone who I could meet up with face to face and who knew my town .\n(11) Supporter: On most of the apps , it connects you with people in your town ! people close by . [Providing Suggestions or Information]\n(12) Seeker: I don ' t know if it ' s more than that . What do you mean ? The problem is that I lack the courage to go out and meet people .\n(13) Supporter: Well personally , I have struggled with putting myself down a lot and blaming myself for things that I shouldn ' t blame myself for . You shouldn ' t blame yourself for not having the courage to go meet people , or blame yourself for not having any friends ! And if that is what you are struggling with , then I think the apps would be a really good first step for you ! You can create those bonds and connections with people close by to you on there first , and then when you feel comfortable enough with them you can meet up . That way it ' s less awkward to hangout with someone you don ' t really know . [Self-disclosure]\n(14) Seeker: oh you mean chat online first , before actually meeting in person ?\n(15) Supporter: Yeah , that is what is great about those friendship apps . You can get comfortable with them before you hangout : ) [Providing Suggestions or Information]\n(16) Seeker: That ' s so cool . Thanks for your help .\n\nMotivation:\n",

I think my girlfriend may be cheating on me but I ' m too scared to do anything about it as I don ' t want her to leave me . I feel ashamed of myself but I can ' t help it .\n(4) Supporter: Being in a relationship with someone when you suspect unfaithful behavior is a rough thing to go through . [Affirmation and Reassurance]\n(5) Seeker: Yes it is but I should be leaving her and moving on . Problem is she is a 9 and I ' m a 5 and I love her . Pretty sure she is cheating though so hopefully if I ignore it she may just leave things as they are .\n(6) Supporter: I ' ve dealt with the same problem with my partner more than once . I love him very much and I found him to be a 9 to my 5 as well . However , the question of whether he was cheating or not was destroying my trust in him and everyone else not to mention what self - respect I had . . . I had to break down and talk to him about it . [Self-disclosure]\n(7) Seeker: What happened out of interest when you had the conversation ?\n(8) Supporter: Ignoring this will NOT help things . There is NO relief in pretending a question or concern does not exist . Like I said the question has arisen more than once . The first time he owned to talking to other women , but nothing more . Since that time , he denies everything . [Self-disclosure]\n(9) Seeker: I know . I ' m a typical man and I like the feeling when she is on my arm . I feel like the cat that has got the cream . It ' s superficial and sad I know . I knew this would never last . She is just too attractive for me . Everyone told me Iwas ' punching above my weight ' and now they will all be laughing if it ends . .\n(10) Supporter: Honestly , its not anyone else ' s business . IF you ' re suspicions are in fact correct , then you ' ve got to see that a loving and faithful 5 is better than a heart - breaking 10 . However should you find that maybe the devils of insecurities are tricking you into thinking that she ' s cheating , then remember that what the two of you share o = is FOR THE TWO of you . Its a relationship , not a community project ! Even mu advice , albeit in the air to help you best I can . is not more important that what matters most to YOU and HER ! Curiously , why do you think she ' s cheating ? [Affirmation and Reassurance]\n(11) Seeker: I ' m almost certain of it , she is super protective of her phone and never used to be . She is always texting and vague when I ask who she is messaging . She goes away with work and when she does she rarely messages me . Recently she said when was going way for a work trip for three nights but when I called her office her colleague said they got back after two . .\n(12) Supporter: Hmm . . . So have you two live together ? How long has this kind of behavior persisted ? When you ask her about this behavior , how do you present the question and how does she react ? Finally , how often do you talk with her about the situation ? [Question]\n(13) Seeker: That ' s just it . I kind of know she is cheating but I haven ' t approached it with her because I ' m scared see will just leave and I ' ll be a laughing stock . I suppose I ' m a joke either way !\n(14) Supporter: Don ' t get me wrong , I completely understand why you have suspicions . Really I think anyone would in the same shoes . . . However , as humans , we tend to either assume the best or the worst of others . There ' s always a margin of error present as a variable in such situations . [Affirmation and Reassurance]\n(15) Seeker: very true . I suppose I have just assumed at this stage with no real evidence . do you think I should just talk to her ?\n(16) Supporter: Forgive me if this comes off as disrespectful . . . I only want to help you . . [Affirmation and Reassurance]\n(17) Seeker: not at all . I appreciate your candour .\n(18) Supporter: But if you feel as though you ' re a joke regardless , then why stay in a relationship where you ' re getting hurt ? I know that you don ' t want to lose the beauty but would you not be happier with loyalty ? [Question]\n(19) Seeker: All this is tied up with who and I know I ' m valuing the wrong things . You are right actually . I think some of this comes from my low self - esteem . having a 9 helps with that . but maybe I need to deal with it directly .\n\nMotivation:\n",

[Affirmation and Reassurance]\n(12) Seeker: I have done both methods . I definitely prefer in - school studies . .\n(13) Supporter: Do you feel it is more stressful online ? [Question]\n(14) Seeker: I am just disappointed that I have been slacking off and procrastinating . no it ' s just that it ' s a different avenue . I have done many online courses before even with the pandemic . I think it ' s because of the pandemic that has made me procrastinating more and being aimless and slow . .\n(15) Supporter: Maybe take a hour a day before you start to do something you want to do then you will feel more motivated to get it done after . [Providing Suggestions or Information]\n(16) Seeker: yeah I take breaks in between . .\n(17) Supporter: Yea this pandemic has me not as motivated to . [Self-disclosure]\n(18) Seeker: But sometimes a lot more breaks or longer breaks than intended or I should . yeah definitely . Sorry to hear that . . It ' s like everyday is the same and I can ' t go out to refresh my mind or have a change of pace such as going to the gym or go out for a run . whereas before the pandemic , I can switch gears that way and come back refreshed . like going out to the movies and coming back with renewed enthusiasm .\n(19) Supporter: Yea i have been missing the gym myself . Now i lookup youtube videos of workouts and do them , and it really helps to get me going in the day . Do you ever listen to music while you are trying to get work done ? When i do that it tends to help time go faster and i get more done . [Self-disclosure]\n(20) Seeker: I see . Yeah it ' s good to have a routine and good way to resume life as usual . . sometimes I listen to music but I find it hard to read and absorb and listen to music . But I do listen to music sometimes when I am on assignments . . I also tend to drink coffee to focus my mind better . It does help . And I know I can pass the courses and on time but just that I am disappointed at my performance and work ethics as I know I have done much better before . So I am missing that sense of urgency , conscientiousness , and maturity . ,\n(21) Supporter: maybe find a nice meditation song to help relax you , i find when i am doing something finding a song with no words is better so i am able to concentrate . [Providing Suggestions or Information]\n(22) Seeker: I see . That ' s a good idea . I was also thinking I should have a regular workout routine at home again because I used to work out much more daily , even at home . .\n(23) Supporter: It sounds like you are a very smart person and are able to acknowledge when you need to work harder on something . Don ' t be to hard on yourself this pandemic is affecting everyone . [Affirmation and Reassurance]\n(24) Seeker: working out does help me focus and be productive . . Thank you and I do agree with you on the pandemic . But this is a part of my mistake too but I think coming away from our conversation , I am more optimistic now having talked to someone about it . .\n(25) Supporter: Yes i would imagine that would help to , i found that before i started working out at home i was beginning to feel lazy and not getting anything done , but that has all changed now . [Self-disclosure]\n(26) Seeker: I see . Hopefully your routines are much better and more productive now .\n(27) Supporter: Aww well try not to be to hard on yourself . Set some daily goals and i bet you will be back to feeling normal in no time . I am glad talking has helped ! [Others]\n(28) Seeker: yeah that ' s another thing . It does work better for me if I were to write down some sort of itinerary of what I should get through today , etc . So you ' re right . . well thank you for listening then and providing some very helpful input . . Yeah you ' ve been more than helpful ! Thank you . .\n(29) Supporter: You are welcome , best of luck with all your studies !

It ' s absurd . No on wants to take responsibility for taking responsibility . . It ' s a very uncertain situation and it ' s a psychological reality that when we don ' t have physical or metnal security , it ' s extremely hard for a human being to progress through stages in life or learn new skill as well or at all . [Reflection of feelings]\n(24) Seeker: I guess it ' s like you said before , we can only change ourselves .\n(25) Supporter: So everyone ' s plans are canceled for the year , plus no one has any idea when the shit ' s going to end , so not unlike a dog at the vet , the suffering seems interminable . .

It is hard to escape the sadness .\n(7) Supporter: wow . in our connected world it is hard to get away . do you want to tell me how it happened . [Restatement or Paraphrasing]\n(8) Seeker: Yeah it is . Well we have been having trouble staying closely connected since the lockdown . We tried to make time for one another , but it has been tough . I was the one who broke things off because I know longer felt much love coming from her . I felt neglected and I thought a break up was the best solution . I did not think she would pick up a new guy two weeks later . I was not prepared to deal with this kind of pain and it hurts .\n(9) Supporter: It was wise of you to know your feeling towards the relationship and make a mature decision for the both of you .

[Reflection of feelings]\n(16) Seeker: Thank you for the help and the advice . I think I will follow through and make the trip happen . Any tips on eventually getting back out in the dating game in these strange times ?\n(17) Supporter: Again , I think you were the mature one that ended the relationship . It is hard to see her \" move on \" , but you will do the same . covid has changed the environments to meet people though , and all I can suggest is to be patient . The world will get back to normal . and you will too . . [Affirmation and Reassurance]\n(18) Seeker: Thanks I appreciate that . I can spend some time focusing on my career and relationships with friends before looking for another romantic endeavor . I appreciate your help with this situation .\n\nMotivation:\n",

[Question]\n(3) Seeker: I ' ve been remote working for the entire pandemic . At first , it was great . I didn ' t go into the office very often before , so I felt relief from feeling any obligation to do so . But now I wonder if I am presenting myself well if my clients and coworkers have so much less personal interaction .\n(4) Supporter: yeah I agree . This pandemic has really been weighing on us . As it pertains to work , you feel like the lacking of personal interaction has distanced yourself and colleagues and you feel like there is an increasingly large barrier given the physical constraint ? [Restatement or Paraphrasing]\n(5) Seeker: Yes . I can be terse and maybe even come across as confrontational online . But when I interact in person , we share so more - body language , facial expressions , we don ' t have as much of a time constraint . I feel like a lot of my value may be overshadowed by unfavorable impressions .\n(6) Supporter: Can you tell me more about your work responsibilities - is it of a customer service nature ? It would help me understand your situation better . I can relate to words vs . the combination of facial expression , body language , etc . The single channel of communication has stripped a lot of meaning and value and has made performance a lot more difficult . The transition is challenging and the uncertainty of the future also adds to the stress . [Others]\n(7) Seeker: Yes , it is of customer service nature . I provide expertise and technical products . I often advise others who do not have the same level of knowledge . I have to convey ideas that may seem quite abstract . Challenging face - to - face , and I have fewer online tools to help share knowledge in a meaningful way .\n(8) Supporter: Thank you for sharing that . I have a better understanding now . What you feel is very valid , and I am sure it is shared among a lot of people this year . I am somewhat familiar with technical leadership . It requires a lot of mentoring and a level of comprehension of what others are doing . [Affirmation and Reassurance]\n(9) Seeker: Thanks . It helps to know that I ' m not alone . Most often , I work independently my work . Involves a lot of explaining and justification . Before we just all sat in the same room and worked together .\n(10) Supporter: My current work is in the finance section . Prior to pandemic , the touch base with colleagues are rather pleasant . Now the workload has decreased and we are rigidly arranging for meetings in 30 minute time slots . It is challenging in a sense that it is harder to fill the gap . yeah it is a classroom for us to learn to adapt to the new normal . I understand the removal of everyone being the same room and chat tools don ' t convey the meaning 100 percent . [Self-disclosure]\n(11) Seeker: So , perhaps limiting meeting times can help the team focus on issues ?\n(12) Supporter: I would personally suggest more happy hours , in case you haven ' t already done so . [Providing Suggestions or Information]\n(13) Seeker: Ah , something more casual ?\n(14) Supporter: Holiday care packages would also be a good common ground for folks to gather around over something that is not work . [Providing Suggestions or Information]\n(15) Seeker: That ' s a great idea ! I would love to get a care package , actually !\n(16) Supporter: Yeah maybe also virtual meditation sessions can help concentration mind and body . It doesn ' t have to be hobbies of our own , but doing it as a team virtually can bring people together and boost morale . [Others]\n(17) Seeker: Thank you ! I will suggest that my organization arrange these . We can even ask all the employees to showcase their hobbies , or some such . I will pass these suggestions on !

[Providing Suggestions or Information]\n(14) Seeker: Yes , I could do better at that . I want him to have fun and do things with friends , but I want him to be willing to work for what he wants , too . . I do struggle with expectations .

I can see that I need to do that more , though .\n(17) Supporter: I ' ve had to learn this lesson many times with my own children .

[Restatement or Paraphrasing]\n(4) Seeker: He got arrested for stealing to fund his addiction .\n(5) Supporter: I had a neighbor who was doing meth , and he got arrested , and that actually saved his life . He had to get sober and look at what he was doing . There is a hard line between helping a friend who is addicted and actually enabling them . Have you ever heard of this ?

I ' ve punished myself trying to stay in his life .\n(13) Supporter: It ' s very hard to lose friends to addictions . It ' s epidemic in our society now . However , you can pray for them and look for ways to keep your life on track so you don ' t get lost focusing on them and not where you want to go . [Reflection of feelings]\n(14) Seeker: all drugs are bad , but meth is a truly evil drug . It ' s just rotting his soul and body . He believes he can ' t stop and you ' re right , letting go and just sending prayers is all i can really do now .\n(15) Supporter: very evil , I agree , I like to write out a list of things I can do to distract myself from overly being concerned , if that makes sense . Like I take time to think about them and pray for them , then I have to move on with my life , so a list helps me think of where I want to go and how to get there . Even if it is just a list of how to clean my pantry ! lol . My husband just got me a daytimer , and I write my goals in that for the new year , and I try to check it every day and try to focus on moving forward , because life has a way of throwing us curveballs like this , and we can ' t get stuck in them . [Affirmation and Reassurance]\n(16) Seeker: That ' s a good idea . I don ' t have many friends left , close friends that is , and this guy is my best friend of 20 years . We were in a touring rock band together . He ' s my last close friend .\n(17) Supporter: It is hard to lose friends that we have had for years . Maybe you can write that on your list - - perhaps just brainstorm ways to make new friends - take a college class , join a gym , take a dance class , volunteer at church , something like that . That way you open up yourself to make new friends . I have had to walk away from many unhealthy relationships over the years , it isn ' t easy , but it ' s part of maturing in life . [Reflection of feelings]\n(18) Seeker: I ' m a single dad so my world is my children . I guess that ' s enough for me really .

How can I handle this sleepless nights ?\n(15) Supporter: That ' s a tough one . I personally still struggle with sleep for other reasons . Some things that can help is taking melatonin 30 minutes before bed . I have also had some luck with white noise machines or other soothing sound machines . The biggest thing is to not use your bedroom for anything but sleeping ; so don ' t read a book or play on your phone in bed , you have to train your body that when you go to bed it is time to sleep . [Providing Suggestions or Information]\n(16) Seeker: Sounds like stuff I can try out . I have a strong attachment to my phone . Will be a tough one to try leaving it off while I try to get some sleep .\n(17) Supporter: Having a bedtime routine is also another tip . Try to do the same thing every night before bed . Have a consistent bedtime , wake up around the same time everyday , even on days that you don ' t have to go to work . Yes , phone ' s are tough to give up but soooo many studies show how bad they are for your sleep . I believe in you though , you will get through this . [Providing Suggestions or Information]\n(18) Seeker: Good thoughts there . Will definitely try out the tips . I feel better already just talking to you . Thank you , Bye .\n\nMotivation:\n",

[Reflection of feelings]\n(7) Seeker: I know I ' m not alone and that ' s what makes it hard to reach out , because I don ' t want people to think that I think my problems are worse then there ' s . It just seems like everyone was happy to find different ways to stay in touch when the lockdown all first started but the longer it goes on the less everyone seems to be trying to connect .\n(8) Supporter: I bet there are lots of people feel the same as you do .

You did the right choice . Safety is always the first concern . [Others]\n(17) Seeker: I did take walks along the path in our development last summer so the cabin fever wasn ' t as bad as it seems to be with all the snow that basically kept me inside all of february .\n(18) Supporter: Does where you live have a online social activity group on FB or an app called Neighbors ? That could be a good way to communicate with others in a safe way . [Question]\n(19) Seeker: The local FB group is only full of everyone complaining about everyone else ( seems when everyone is home things seem to get on peoples nerves more so then when people could get away from home consistently ) but I ' ve never heard of the app Neighbors , I ' ll have to look into that .\n(20) Supporter: Give that a try .

[Question]\n(2) Seeker: I ' m feeling really down about my breakup .\n(3) Supporter: \\ So you have had a breakup recently and you are feeling down about it . [Restatement or Paraphrasing]\n(4) Seeker: Yes . I thought that it wouldn ' t be terrible because I initiated it but now I regret it .\n(5) Supporter: So are you doubting that you made the right decision or are you just feeling sadness at the loss you are feeling right now . [Question]\n(6) Seeker: I ' m mainly doubting my decision and I know there ' s nothing I can do about it .\n(7) Supporter: You must have had good reason ' s to have made the decision to breakup and to have initiated it . Its normal to doubt yourself afterwards . You may want to remind yourself of the reasons that you came to your decision you did . Im sure the reasons are still valid . [Affirmation and Reassurance]\n(8) Seeker: I did it because I ' m trying to focus on self - improvement but looking back now , there ' s no reason I couldn ' t have improved myself with my partner .\n(9) Supporter: So you felt the need to have some time to fucus on your own goals and growth and now you feel like you could have stayed in the relationship and you are doubting that you needed to take the step of breaking up . In my experience at times we need to be single for self growth and I have found that personal growth usual thrives when I am single . . [Self-disclosure]\n(10) Seeker: That ' s what I hope for . I just can ' t get over missing my partner because they were great to me , I just needed to be alone .\n(11) Supporter: I think you are feeling a loss even though you feel that at this time you need to be alone to focus on your own growth . When you had the conversation about this breakup were you honest about why you need the space and that your problem was not with the relationship but with maybe the timing . I think with communication and after growth perhaps by keeping the door open with this person maybe you can have some sort of relationship in the future even if its friendship or maybe more . You are doing what is right for yourself at the given time . [Providing Suggestions or Information]\n(12) Seeker: I did get the chance to explain my reasons a few days after the breakup . We were friendly and talked casually for a few more days and then they said they needed to space to get themselves together . We haven ' t really talked since then . The problem is I ' m open to something in the future but I don ' t know that they are and I can ' t find the courage to ask .\n(13) Supporter: I have been in both situations before the one who needed space and also as the one who was broken up with . I think right now the best thing you can do for you and the person is to stick with your decision and give them time they also may need space to process and deal with the breakup and growth for themselves without really letting go you won ' t be able to grow in time you can have a conversation and ask but it might be six months down the road wait for them to come to you they have asked for time as you did too soon . [Providing Suggestions or Information]\n(14) Seeker: I think I can do that . They needed space because it was hard going from being in a relationship to being friends in a matter of days . I guess I ' ll just have to continue working on myself and see how things go .\n(15) Supporter: Focusing on yourself sounds like the best thing you can do . Start on that list of self improvements you want to make . Connect with friends you may have lost touch with . Your going to be great . [Affirmation and Reassurance]\n(16) Seeker: I like that idea .

So I am trying to cut out drinking .\n(9) Supporter: So you feel that the drinking itself gives you the anxiety ? Do you suffer from anxiety when you do not drink ever ? [Question]\n(10) Seeker: Sometimes but I think the root from them comes from when I do something while I ' m drinking . Not that I do anything bad , but I just don ' t like not remembering things .\n(11) Supporter: So you would say that you drink to the point of blacking out ? Or you just seem to get foggy on details when you ' ve had a reasonable amount of alcohol ?

Have you noticed it could be related to that or simply the amount of alcohol you are drinking ? . [Question]\n(14) Seeker: It is typically the amount I ' m drinking , but cutting out drinking as a whole has probably helped me the most .\n(15) Supporter: Certainly making sure that you only drink a certain amount like a couple drinks of beer or only a shot of harder drinks might alleviate this or refraining from mixing drinks . Sometimes also it could be due to the company you keep . . . the amount you drink . Do your friends encourage you to drink more ? [Question]\n(16) Seeker: They don ' t necessarily attempt to get me to drink more in volume , but I do have to tell them I ' m not gonna go out for the night .\n(17) Supporter: Are they okay with it when you decline ? [Question]\n(18) Seeker: Yes after one or two statements they give up . .\n(19) Supporter: Okay so they ask you a couple of times and then they move on . That ' s good that they don ' t push you too much . Certainly keep with it if not drinking helps you to not make bad decisions . I ' m sure you have other interests in life that maybe you could drag your friends out to enjoy so that might help . . . sober fun ! Also if you find that you ' re struggling with not drinking that might be a time to look for support . Maybe see a therapist as there may be psychological reasons you can not refrain from drinking . Maybe look into a group like AA or something similar to share your struggles with others .

I don ' t think it would be pushing if you haven ' t had that conversation in almost a year . [Self-disclosure]\n(13) Seeker: I hope you are right , just don ' t want to come across as a desperate person and that ' s why I ' m setting myself up to call it quits if he tries to sound like he sounded the last time .\n(14) Supporter: You need to know where he is so you can make a good decision for yourself !

The dialogue clip is:\n(1) Seeker: Hi there , are you free to talk ? I am feeling rather sad .\n(2) Supporter: Hi there . Yes , What is making you sad ? [Question]\n(3) Seeker: I feel that my friends do not like me very much any more . Apparently they have been engaging in group activities without me .\n(4) Supporter: I understand how frustrating that can be to not be part of the group activities . [Question]\n(5) Seeker: Do you think that I am over - reacting ? I do not want to sound over sensitive but this has been happening for a while .\n(6) Supporter: Have you talked with your friends on how you feel ? When was the last time you all connected ? [Question]\n(7) Seeker: We went out for coffee the other day and I thought about saying something cos I know they went to a club without me last weekend but I couldn ' t bring myself to in the end .\n(8) Supporter: I understand it is tough to bring up what is bothering you , especially after getting to hang out with all your friend over coffee . I ' m sure this was not intentional with not inviting you to the club . [Restatement or Paraphrasing]\n(9) Seeker: Sometimes in the past I have turned down invitations to go out clubbing , admittedly . Could it be that they just did not think that I wanted to go ? .\n(10) Supporter: From what I have experienced personally , I am not a fan of clubs and didnt want to go with my friends . After turning them down a few times , they stopped inviting as well . I think they thought that was not my thing . [Providing Suggestions or Information]\n(11) Seeker: The thing is though that this is not the only thing - they have been to rock concerts without me too . I just feel I am no longer a part of the group .\n(12) Supporter: I feel how this is hurting you . The best thing would be to talk to them about feeling disinvited to group activities . Let them know you are still free and really want to spend some time together . Do you think you can open up to them on whats bothering you ? [Providing Suggestions or Information]\n(13) Seeker: I don ' t know . I don ' t want to come across as just being paranoid or whiny . Sometimes I think it would be better to just forget them and not have any friends .\n(14) Supporter: It sounds like this situation is really bothering you . Its hard and overwhelming to feel isolated . The bonds of friendship are worth the confrontation . If they don ' t know what is bothering you , it will be harder to mend the relationship . [Affirmation and Reassurance]\n(15) Seeker: It is making me really depressed and is badly damaging my sense of self worth . I feel as though I am not worth anyone ' s time .\n(16) Supporter: You are worth every precious second of time and should not let this diminish your self worth . Find common ground , an activity you all enjoy and invite them to hang with you . [Providing Suggestions or Information]\n(17) Seeker: Thank you that is helpful . What if I reach out and they all snub me though ?\n(18) Supporter: We all have busy hectic lives at time . True friends make time to be with one another . This world is full of beautiful people to bond with . Keeping a closed circle of friends is a blessing . [Providing Suggestions or Information]\n(19) Seeker: It ' s not really so much that my life is hectic . On the contrary , sometimes it feels as though it is rather empty and not having the support of friends does not help with that . Anyway I do appreciate your help - you have given me things to think about .\n\nMotivation:\n",

[Affirmation and Reassurance]\n(13) Seeker: Whilst it hurts to think about him being dead , I think that it would hurt more if I had totally forgotten about him and did not think about him every day .\n(14) Supporter: I just need you to know that whatever your feeling is , it ' s completely normal and you shouldn ' t feel guilty for having it . [Affirmation and Reassurance]\n(15) Seeker: It is just - very hard . I keep thinking about all the times I disagreed with him or did not appreciate him enough and I never got to tell him how much I loved him .\n(16) Supporter: Your dad wouldn ' t want to see you grieving everyday either . You should live the way you know he ' d love to see . I believe he knew you loved him regardless how much you two argued . [Affirmation and Reassurance]\n(17) Seeker: I know that he did : ) . I had just not expected to lose him at such a comparatively young age . He did not get to enjoy his retirement !\n(18) Supporter: That ' s sad when he spent all his time taking care of the family and yet could not enjoy his free time . [Reflection of feelings]\n(19) Seeker: Yes . I think it would have been easier to deal with had he not immediately descended into very bad health as soon as he retired and had had time to have some fun .\n(20) Supporter: have you considered seeking therapist ? We almost never think of that service , but in a lot of case , people actually need help from professionals when grieving . [Question]\n(21) Seeker: I can ' t really afford to have therapy at the moment . Also I know that my dad was just have considered it to be a waste of money - he was very careful with money .\n(22) Supporter: he seemed to be a great man . Instead of regretting what happened , celebrate how great of a person he was . [Others]\n(23) Seeker: That is a really sensible suggestion and it cheers me up to think of it .

Are there at least some type of protocols and protection in place for your well - being ?

I am not sure how much to suggest as it ' s not legal in my country : ) [Providing Suggestions or Information]\n(8) Seeker: It was recently legalized in our state .

Even twenty five years ago in my student days it was rare for anyone to be prosecuted for pot . The US seems to be really strict on it tho .

I ' m suffering with increased depression and I ' m not quite clear why .\n(3) Supporter: I ' m sorry to hear that . Is there any change in your routine as of lately ? [Question]\n(4) Seeker: No not really . I have suffered from depression before but it seems to have spiked recently . The only thing that is different these days is lockdown . I think that ' s the same for everyone .\n(5) Supporter: These past few months has been extremely difficult . In the past , what did you do for your depression ? [Reflection of feelings]\n(6) Seeker: I saw a psychiatrist face to face but only once every month . I ' ve always had a low mood but now I ' m anxious that it will continue to get worse .\n(7) Supporter: Talking to a professional is always ideal . Is there a way to see that psychiatrist again ? [Providing Suggestions or Information]\n(8) Seeker: Since lockdown haven ' t spoken to her but maybe she can do a video call .

If she isn ' t available , there are other services . [Providing Suggestions or Information]\n(10) Seeker: What like support groups etc ? I ' m also sure this isn ' t just related to lockdown and not seeing my specialist . It ' s weird and a little concerning to be honest .\n(11) Supporter: Not necessarily support groups , but more like psychiatry apps where a trained professional is available via chat , or video and its specifically through the app . [Providing Suggestions or Information]\n(12) Seeker: I hadn ' t thought of that . I know there are a few of these nowadays .\n(13) Supporter: There a lot more since Covid began in March , so it ' s worth as a backup plan if your doctor isn ' t available . Sometimes its good to have options . [Affirmation and Reassurance]\n(14) Seeker: I ' ll start a plan and seeing if I can see my usual therapist and go from there . Sometimes it just helps talk it through depression stops you from seeing things clearly . Do you have any experience with mental health issues ? .\n(15) Supporter: After my son was born I developed Post Partem depression and anxiety . It wasn ' t until almost a year and half after he was born to realize it . [Self-disclosure]\n(16) Seeker: That must have been difficult to deal with . Mental health affects so many people in so many ways . It ' s good that it ' s recognised these days at least .\n(17) Supporter: It was . Luckily I had my doctor to help me . Family members meant well but chalked it up to \" that ' s what its like to be a mom \" but it is more than that . [Self-disclosure]\n(18) Seeker: I think this is why it ' s always best to see a professional . I really should try to reconnect with mine .\n(19) Supporter: I agree .

I have tried , but they are immature and just want to party . I ' ve started staying in my room which helps , but is very isolating . I wish I could afford my own place .\n\nMotivation:\n",

No , this is not my first breakup with a woman but I felt like she was the one for me .\n(14) Supporter: Breakups are not always the end , but they usually happen for a reason , and whenever violence is involved it is usually better to move on . [Reflection of feelings]\n(15) Seeker: Maybe you ' re right !

[Providing Suggestions or Information]\n(17) Seeker: I will definitely try . I know it will be hard because I am upset still but sometimes I guess moving on is the only thing that you can do in this situation .\n(18) Supporter: The sadness will eventually pass and I am sure there is someone out there that will be a good match for you .

I Feel like I ' m never finding anyone like her ever again ,\n(9) Supporter: The first step of a break should be to starting loving thyself . If you get out there and find hobbies you enjoy , who knows , you may find someone that will love you more than you could imagine . Take it from me , I ' ve had this happen .

I told him that if he cared about me , he would move on because thats truly what I would want him to do and I think thats what your girl would want you to do as well .

As if she didn ' t want me to see something .\n(21) Supporter: Im sorry that this stressful for you . In my past , I have had exes do that to me . Most likely she was cheating on you and this was the reason for her motives . [Affirmation and Reassurance]\n(22) Seeker: I can ' t believe she would do something like that . . . I really need to confront her about it . I can ' t have this doubt on my chest .\n(23) Supporter: I would definitely confront her about it . I wouldn ' t get angry or fight about it . Maybe she if she has a new boyfriend already . That is a really good indicator . [Providing Suggestions or Information]\n(24) Seeker: You are right . I need to take this slowly and calmly .\n\nMotivation:\n",

They are sympathetic but they do not really understand .\n(30) Supporter: i had an emergency ovary removal in my early 30s and didn ' t know if i woudl be able to have children . my doctor told me that the most important thing i could do was to be healthy becuse a healthy mother was what i could give my children even if i adopted them . [Self-disclosure]\n(31) Seeker: That sounds like very good advice from both you and your doctor . It is a difficult thing to have to confront though . I really do appreciate the fact that you have taken the time to talk honestly with me .\n(32) Supporter: you want an empathetic friend . nobody has gone through the exact same thing you have but the emotions are common ones . you will be ok , even if you dont feel that way now .

[Question]\n(24) Seeker: yes and i think he is using me to a degree also .\n(25) Supporter: Let me get this straight - you do have feelings for him but you are confused and you think that there ' s an element of mutual manipulation . [Reflection of feelings]\n(26) Seeker: yes .\n(27) Supporter: You are definitely not the only person to feel this way ! [Affirmation and Reassurance]\n(28) Seeker: it ' s a difficult situation . i think it will become clearer the deeper i get into it . thing is he is the head of the board and holds the power . . what it comes down to is im wondering if he has feelings for me .\n(29) Supporter: I feel that you are paying too much attention to your position on the board . [Affirmation and Reassurance]\n(30) Seeker: i feel it gives me an advantage i want at the moment .\n(31) Supporter: But that is rather manipulative of you . [Reflection of feelings]\n(32) Seeker: if you were me you would forget about him and the board .\n(33) Supporter: Yes I definitely would do that . [Affirmation and Reassurance]\n(34) Seeker: thing is he is encouraging me to be like that . cuz it helps him too . okay . i ' ll try to lay low and walk away from it .\n(35) Supporter: I think it ' s time for a clear severance . Do you have any other people you are interested in ? Any hobbies ? [Others]\n(36) Seeker: yes but it ' s less than before cuz of Covid lockdowns . so it makes me more susceptible to this - if that makes sense .\n(37) Supporter: Ah I hear you . You feel that your options are rather more limited than previously because of the lockdown ? [Affirmation and Reassurance]\n(38) Seeker: yes .\n(39) Supporter: That is something I believe that most of us are feeling right now so I sympathise . [Affirmation and Reassurance]\n(40) Seeker: true . i just have to be strong about it with him . even if he likes me i don ' t think it ' s a healthy relationship . i slept with one of his friends and the other one wanted to sleep with me too .\n(41) Supporter: I can tell that you really have deep reservations and know deep down that this is not a healthy place for you to be . Is he aware that this happened ? [Reflection of feelings]\n(42) Seeker: yes when it comes down to it . he suspected it happened . his friend asked the one i slept with if it was true . he denied it . so i think he suspected it .\n(43) Supporter: Do you feel guilty about this ? [Question]\n(44) Seeker: now that im talking to him i do a little . it felt good at the time like i was getting back at him . you can tell this is a very twisted situation .\n(45) Supporter: Do you feel that you want to get revenge on him ? [Question]\n(46) Seeker: not really . i just felt that if he stayed with me i wouldn ' t have slept with his friend and almost did with his other one .\n(47) Supporter: I am not sure what to say that will help your problem and give you closure .

I don ' t think I can ever be happy again .\n(2) Supporter: I am sorry to hear that . reading your opening statement it sounds like you are now suffering from low self - esteem is that true ? [Reflection of feelings]\n(3) Seeker: I have always had problems with low self esteem this makes it worse . I have lost interest in everything I can barely make myself go to work .\n(4) Supporter: do you think if you knew the reasons why the relationship ended it would help you deal with things a lot better ? [Question]\n(5) Seeker: Maybe , why would he cheat ? I have seen her she is not that pretty . I thought something was going on the last few months but he kept telling me everything was fine and that it was all my imagination .\n(6) Supporter: remember the fact that he cheated is not your fault . if he entered into a committed relationship with you you should not be cheating . if things aren ' t right you should be talking this through with you before deciding to move on and see someone else . [Others]\n(7) Seeker: I thought I was a good girlfriend , I was loyal , nice to his friends , kept the house nice , cooked for him , he never said he was unhappy he just started having to work nights and weekends a lot with no overtime he said he was salary now . I must just be unlovable .\n(8) Supporter: have you tried getting back out there and dating again ? just because he didn ' t want to have an honest relationship with you , doesn ' t mean that nobody else does . also in my message above I have made a couple of autocorrect errors , apologies for that .

How do people make it through the pain , it actually hurts .\n(12) Supporter: Do you have someone who you can talk to about this to support you ? . [Providing Suggestions or Information]\n(13) Seeker: I have a couple acquaintances at work but I wouldn ' t want to discuss my personal life with , my mom said to have a good cry but I almost couldn ' t stop once I started . He was my best friend and who I talked to once we got together I didn ' t seem to need anyone else which looks like a mistake now . That is why I am here for support .\n(14) Supporter: Ok I understand . It is normal to be upset in a situation like this . When I ask if there is someone to talk to , I meant perhaps a friend or someone who has experienced a similar breakup . There are also support groups out there that can really help . Getting your emotions out and seeing that others struggle with the same issue may be a very good thing . [Providing Suggestions or Information]\n(15) Seeker: Have you ever had a break up of a serious relationship or know someone who has ? Does the aching inside ever get better ? How long will it take ?\n(16) Supporter: When I was younger , my girlfriend cheated on me . We were together for 4 years . For me , it turned to anger not sadness , I was so angry that she did that to me . I realised that if she was capable of doing this , it ' s better that I found out now , rather than when we were engaged or married . I loved her but after she cheated , I couldn ' t stand the sight of her . I completely understand the feelings you are experiencing . The good news is that I have since met someone wonderful , we have children and I am now very happy . [Self-disclosure]\n(17) Seeker: I am sorry that happened to you but glad it turned out well in the end . You have a good point that it is better to know now than after we got married . I do have a nice neighbor who expressed concern when he noticed my boyfriend was gone . He said if I ever needed someone to talk to he was there . I thought he was just being nice . Maybe I should go talk to him some time maybe he was sincere .\n(18) Supporter: I think that that would be a good idea ! for info , In terms of how long it takes to get over it . I have read a statistic that is takes half the length of the relationship to truly get over it . Personally I think it does depend on the person and how things end in terms of the breakup . [Providing Suggestions or Information]\n(19) Seeker: Thank you for checking on that for me , I hope it is quicker I would hate to feel this way that long . I think I will go see him he is home right now . You have made me feel hopeful and that there will be an end to these feelings and maybe things will go as well for me as they did you . Thank you again .\n\nMotivation:\n",

I ' ve been looking for a job for months , but feel like I ' m getting nowhere .\n(4) Supporter: I ' m sorry to hear that but if i may hear your you clearly , what you are saying is that you don ' t have any job for a long time now . [Restatement or Paraphrasing]\n(5) Seeker: Well , I am fortunate to have a job , but I am seeking a different job because the one I have does not pay what my skills are worth . It barely pays enough for me to pay my essential bills .\n(6) Supporter: ok , that is a bit of relief . have u check for job vacancy in your state . [Affirmation and Reassurance]\n(7) Seeker: I have , but there are few decent jobs out there . Most available jobs are in locations where one can not drive safely or their personal safety is at risk .\n(8) Supporter: oh , safety is everything . have you ever consider changing your location . i once change my location to pursue my goal and it pan out well . [Reflection of feelings]\n(9) Seeker: Last week , I submitted an application package for my dream job . I have over 15 years of experience and the employer offers housing ( which I have seen before , and it is quite nice ) . I have heard nothing at all . I would have to relocate 4 hours away , but I would do it in a heartbeat for this job .\n(10) Supporter: wow , i pray that work out . i believe it will work out . [Affirmation and Reassurance]\n(11) Seeker: What makes this job so special to me is that it is not like a regular job : it is at a conference center resort owned by my church denomination . I have attended religious retreats there and am now in the process of seeking a new confirmation into this church because it is a different church than that of my childhood . Working there would be ministry , not typical work . And because the majority of staff and guests are from one of our sister churches , one is working mostly with friends and building long relationships .\n(12) Supporter: wow , that ' s a big deal . i know you might not be the only one fighting for this position but i trust you will get it . [Affirmation and Reassurance]\n(13) Seeker: Thank you . I believe there are three things in my favor : I know the job well , as I became friends with the person I would be replacing , My pastor wrote a glowing reference , and I was also able to get a reference from the person who trained me for my current ( related ) job fifteen years ago .\n(14) Supporter: even by working there , you will surely meet new friends . do you know many people from the church ? [Providing Suggestions or Information]\n(15) Seeker: We worked together for almost 13 years before she retired , but who would be in a better position to assess my skill than my trainer / work partner ? I know a few of the higher ups from the area churches , and a handful of families . I know half the core staff I would be working with daily and think of them as extended family . .\n(16) Supporter: you just have to be patient and don ' t push it too hard so that you won ' t look desperate . [Providing Suggestions or Information]\n(17) Seeker: The benefits are nice , also , such as staff are provided meals prepared by the banquet chef and his team when at work . And though everyone has a role , the office staff support each other well and work as a team .\n(18) Supporter: wow , banquet at work . that is a wonderland stuff . [Restatement or Paraphrasing]\n(19) Seeker: At the risk of preaching religion , I believe God may be calling me to serve there . .\n(20) Supporter: that is definitely a dream job . God is everywhere . just put your trust in Him . He never sleep nor slumber . [Affirmation and Reassurance]\n(21) Seeker: When off duty , staff are encouraged to enjoy the facilities and mingle with guests . There is an Olympic sized pool , field games , a gymnasium , an exercise room , and if off duty , one can attend most any of the events on the campus , unless designated as a private event .\n(22) Supporter: wow ! Olympic size pool . Keep praying . the job is yours . [Restatement or Paraphrasing]\n(23) Seeker: Because my job is to sell repeat business , it is essential that I get out and meet guests and make certain that their needs are met , but it usually comes in the form of serving snacks at intermission and saying hellos as one passes . It would feel like a family reunion , but in a family where everyone gets along .\n(24) Supporter: that is good , i work in such place where everyone is like a family . [Reflection of feelings]\n(25) Seeker: The music events year round are outstanding . They have many well known names in Christian music as well as speakers who are well worth hearing . To be able to hear these messages at no cost makes the job priceless .\n(26) Supporter: i can feel your excitement . [Affirmation and Reassurance]\n(27) Seeker: As I said to my pastor , just to work somewhere where people say thank you and ask how you are doing rather than criticize every move would be such a blessing . And since I work nights already , I am more than happy to cover the office overnight to attend to guests who have locked themselves out , or have other concerns . I used to live on site at the motel where I work now , and on my days off , all I did was make keys and walk the grounds to ensure safety . At this facility , there are beautiful benches to sit and watch the moon and stars and enjoy the sunrise or just take a moment . There are covered gazebos and a couple buildings have deep covered porches for days when it ' s a bit rainy or the sun is strong . And we ' re across the street from mountains and a river . The campus is simply beautiful .\n(28) Supporter: we are trying to make impact and survive which is what you have been doing with your current work . but sooner or later you will get your real job . [Providing Suggestions or Information]\n(29) Seeker: I pray you are right . I feel as though I have been running on a hamster wheel , but it has brought me to this . Fifteen years of directly related experience , with about another 15 to 20 years of customer service , call center , and customer facing work .\n(30) Supporter: I hope and pray everything happens the way you wished . you have been working hard . I will put you in my prayers . [Reflection of feelings]\n(31) Seeker: Thank you . I don ' t mind the work , but it would be nice to also have appreciation , that is what makes the current job difficult is that I feel taken for granted . . Thank you .\n\nMotivation:\n",

I know you ' re probably prepping for the holiday . I didn ' t mean to interrupt your Sunday .\n(6) Supporter: Im sorry but we do not get those promps . We just get to talk pretty much , we have to find out whats going on . You are not interrupting anything . [Others]\n(7) Seeker: Here ! Last Christmas I bought the condo of my dreams . This April 2020 I lost my job due Covid 19 . My unemployment is ending and my savings are depleted . I ' ve recived an eviction notice and don ' t know what to do . Help ! Have you ever been evicted ?\n(8) Supporter: Where are you that you are able to be evicted ? You should not be able to be evicted from your home during this time in pretty much every state . Have you tried contacting anyone for help other than your landlord ? [Question]\n(9) Seeker: I ' m still in my condo but I no longer have a job , umemployment has run out and my savings are all gone .\n(10) Supporter: Well the plus side is they cannot kick you out right now . Have you talk to your landlord about working out some payment arrangement . Have you tried applying for any job ? Now is not the time for pride to get in the way , i would accept anything . [Providing Suggestions or Information]\n(11) Seeker: When you say work out a plan what do you mean ? I have no job . I have been applying for jobs but I haven ' t received a callback or an offer of employment . Have you ever been in this situation ? Also , I ' m calling a helpline so Pride is not my issue .\n(12) Supporter: I have but the referendum on evictions with covid makes this situation different . I am sorry if that pride comment came off as crass . I was just trying to say desperate times come with desperate measures . They could work out a way you can pay extra monthly when you get back on your feet . [Providing Suggestions or Information]\n(13) Seeker: It ' s kind of hard to work out a plan when you don ' t know where your next meal is coming from don ' t you think ? Do you know anything about the eviction process and where do people go once they have been evicted . Who is this they that your speaking about ? I don ' t mean to be crass either but I have never been jobless or homeless either . So I ' m desperate here and don ' t know what to do ?\n(14) Supporter: Your landlord . I worked out a way with payments when i was furloughed from my job . And yes i was actually homeless many years ago so i do know what it feels like to miss out on meals for a days at a time . It seems you should look up evictions during Covid . They are not allowed to throw you on the street as long as the pandemic is going on . [Providing Suggestions or Information]\n(15) Seeker: How did you eat and where did you sleep when you were homeless ? How long did it take to end your situation ? If you were homeless what did you say to your landlord that they still put you out ? Where did you wash up or brush your teeth ?\n(16) Supporter: Oh for my situation it was 100 % my fault i was in a bad place during that time . I spent my time couch surfing til my friends got tired of me . Bounced around shelters after i sold my car . Washing up and brushing my teeth were the least of my problems . May i ask what state you are in ? [Question]\n(17) Seeker: I rather not say . But thank you for you for sharing and i hope you and your family have a good Thanksgiving .\n\nMotivation:\n",

What is on your mind? [Question]\n(3) Seeker: I am disgusted with my friend for cheating on her boyfriend. Am I right to feel this way?\n\nWhat is the last appropriate support strategy to be used by the supporter? Please make inferences with a succinct motivation (max 40 words) based on the dialogue history like this:\nMotivation: The motivation of the supporter in choosing the strategy [Affirmation and Reassurance] is to validate the seeker's feelings and provide reassurance, aiming to build trust and a supportive relationship.\n\n3) Dialogue context to be inferred:\nNow, infer the supporter's choice of the last strategy with a succinct motivation (max 40 words). The dialogue clip is:\n(1) Seeker: Hello , how are you ?\n(2) Supporter: Hi there ! How may I support you ? [Question]\n(3) Seeker: Well , I ' m really upset with my friends .\n(4) Supporter: I am so sorry to hear that . Did something happen ? [Others]\n(5) Seeker: Yes , they aren ' t taking COVID seriously .\n(6) Supporter: Oh that is so hard . I have family that isn ' t taking COVID seriously as well , and its so frustrating to see . Are you able to talk to them about your concerns ? [Self-disclosure]\n(7) Seeker: Yes but they get angry with me . I don ' t know how to get through to them ,\n(8) Supporter: Some people express their frustrations in certain ways . Do you think there is another way to communicate with them ? It ' s also okay to stand up for yourself and stand by what you feel is right . [Providing Suggestions or Information]\n(9) Seeker: I really don ' t know I just haven ' t been seeing them at all but I see through social media that they have large parties but I do feel left out . It ' s a weird dynamic .\n(10) Supporter: It sounds like you ' re finding it hard to balance the isolation you feel during this pandemic , while you know it ' s the safest option , with the social gatherings your friends are having . Does that sound right ? [Restatement or Paraphrasing]\n(11) Seeker: That ' s exactly right .\n(12) Supporter: that is such a hard position to be in . it sounds like you are doing your best by choosing to be safe and keep your distance . [Affirmation and Reassurance]\n(13) Seeker: I ' d like to think so but I wish they would too . It ' s hard to know what is right .\n(14) Supporter: I have found that having vitural movie nights , or going on socially distanced walks with my pals has been so helpful with staying connected . Is this something you think your friends would be willing to try ? [Self-disclosure]\n(15) Seeker: Yes , but they ' ll have their BBQs and parties anyway . They are having a group Thanksgiving and there will be a lot of people there . My husband and I feel bad that we aren ' t going , but we also know it isn ' t smart .\n(16) Supporter: I think a lot of people are going by the notion that you can ' t live your life in fear , and that they ' re going to have these big family gathering regardless of what is happening with COVID . The stats have shown that after holidays the cases have surged , for example , memorial day , 4th of July , labor day . But I think its important to remember the bigger picture that peoples lives are literally at stake and the people that disregard need to be more aware . [Providing Suggestions or Information]\n(17) Seeker: We feel like after this is all over , they will still remind us that we were standoffish during this time . And I agree . The longer we put it off and don ' t take it seriously , the longer it will last .\n(18) Supporter: Can you tell them that that just isn ' t the case ? You and your husband are making the right choice by staying home for the safety of yourselves and others . If I am correct , it has nothing to do with the fact that you don ' t want to see your pals and family ! From chatting with you it sounds like your relationships with these people is incredibly important to you . [Reflection of feelings]\n(19) Seeker: Yes that ' s totally accurate . Yes they are . They are good people . They just think living for the moment is the bigger picture .\n(20) Supporter: I hope your friends can see how important they are to you and thats a huge reason why you ' re not seeing them . [Greeting]\n(21) Seeker: I think they do . They just think that this is a hoax .\n(22) Supporter: I know a lot of people that think the same thing . I have one friend who thought that , and they ended up contracting COVID . Thankfully she was ok , but after she got it she definitely didn ' t think it was a hoax anymore . I hope they understand the risk they are taking . [Self-disclosure]\n(23) Seeker: That ' s scary . Yeah I don ' t think they get it .\n(24) Supporter: I am proud of the choices you are making and I hope you can take some comfort in knowing that you are doing your part in helping keep things under control . There is a strength in numbers and the more people who understand that the faster it can be controlled . [Greeting]\n(25) Seeker: Thank you . I hope it gets better . But anyway thank you for giving me the chance to open up .\n\nMotivation:\n",

[Greeting]\n(3) Seeker: going smooth , i need to get a nice and a surprise able present for my parent , and at the same time I need to pay my house bills . my father understands the situation that my earning is not that much , but my mum will fuck complain that I am taking care of my wife but not her .\n(4) Supporter: It sounds like you ' re having some cash flow issues , right ? I can relate to that at a few more points in my life than I ' d points in my life than I ' d like to recall . It ' s so very loving and sweet of you to be putting so much thought into the gift !

[Restatement or Paraphrasing]\n(5) Seeker: yes , your are right , I cannot stay in house without paying bills . yes , I am working but the income is not that much .\n(6) Supporter: It is pretty ridiculous how income doesn ' t increase along with inflation / cost of living . Very illogical and crippling to many of us financially . Of course you ' ll need to put your rent and utilities above all else , and since the gift you are feeling stressed out about is a parental gift , [Reflection of feelings]\n(7) Seeker: that is the major concern , the gift is once in a year and now all my bills are needed to be paid at least before end of the week .\n(8) Supporter: I think that you will find out that all your parents really want is for you to be happy and to get to spend some quality family time with you . They love you and want you to be happy and healthy . That is a gift a lot of parents don ' t get , surprisingly . . [Providing Suggestions or Information]\n(9) Seeker: may be i should use credit card to get her new year present and use my salary to pay the bills and rent . my presence is much important likewise . i will need to be happy and get rid of this fucking depression , I can ' t kill my fucking self .\n\nMotivation:\n",

[Question]\n(4) Seeker: I ' m having problems with getting up everyday and doing my daily routine . I feel bad because these are things that other people do normally .\n(5) Supporter: Yeah , I ' ve definitely felt that way . . . especially during COVID and having to adjust to working from home . What are some of the things in your routine during the day ? [Reflection of feelings]\n(6) Seeker: Exactly . Jogging , eating breakfast , getting dressed .\n(7) Supporter: Yep , for me it ' s kind of felt like working remotely and all the crazy 2020 stuff was kind of an excuse to just \" take a break \" from grinding . MTurk has kind of helped me get back in a working mindset and given me more energy . . . have you been doing a lot of MTurk lately ? [Providing Suggestions or Information]\n(8) Seeker: Yeah , 2020 has been a crazy year . I ' ve been doing Mturk here and there . I plan on doing it more . It helps me stay productive .\n(9) Supporter: Yeah it helps , just forcing yourself to have goals , for sure . I ' ve been determined to hit a number on MTurk and exercise every time I ' m feeling tired , instead of taking a nap because my boss can ' t see me , lol . I would definitely say just start setting goals and try to look forward to 2021 being better . [Affirmation and Reassurance]\n(10) Seeker: Okay , I hear you . Thanks . Yeah , I guess I have to really force myself .\n(11) Supporter: Force yourself at first , then the \" body in motion , stays in motion \" law will take over . : ) All I know , is that nothing is worse than ending a day without a sense of accomplishment and then stringing those kinds of days together . [Providing Suggestions or Information]\n(12) Seeker: Okay okay . cool . That ' s a helpful concept . I ' m going to force myself to get up and then hopefully my body will get used to it . Yes , that ' s true . I hate ending the day knowing I ' ve bummed it out .\n(13) Supporter: One of the things I ' ve noticed about 2020 and I think this contributes is that this year has taken away almost all incentives . . . you know before it would be like , \" I ' m looking forward to this concert , or this movie coming out next weekend . \" So , when you aren ' t planning things and don ' t have these milestones throughout the year of events breaking up the monotony , it stinks . [Reflection of feelings]\n(14) Seeker: Yes , I agree . I used to go to at least one concert every year . Now that ' s out of the question . It gets boring and a little depressing . Hopefully 2021 will be better .\n(15) Supporter: I ' m sure it will be . Definitely try tomorrow morning to get up and exercise and maybe hit the MTurk hard , also hobbies definitely help and being at home is a great time to learn new skills . [Providing Suggestions or Information]\n(16) Seeker: I will definitely . I just got to get up and get with it . I ' m really in need of some exercise so I ' ll do that too . I used to paint and draw but I kind of fell off and stopped doing it . I ' ll get back into that too .\n(17) Supporter: Oh yeah , nothing is worse than losing joy in something you love doing . But , getting back in an active mindset helps . I used to love to have bonfires , it really was therapeutic for me but then I just lost the will to have them . Since I ' ve been back on MTurk and trying to be more active these last couple weeks , I had one on Saturday and really enjoyed it . So much of the passion lost for hobbies isn ' t because we grow out of them , it ' s quite frankly because we are probably just depressed . [Reflection of feelings]\n(18) Seeker: I agree fully and I ' m happy for you . I think I ' ve been in some sort of depression for some time now . I stopped doing everything I loved . I used to love jogging but I stopped doing that too . I ended up gaining a lot of weight and now I don ' t like going anywhere or being seen at all . I ' m usually 130 and I ' ve shot up to 200 . So I think if I can just get my routine down and exercise , I ' ll be alright .\n\nMotivation:\n",

[Affirmation and Reassurance]\n(5) Seeker: I ' ve been out of work since Covid closed down the live event industry in March . the unemployment system still hasn ' t processed any of my claims , and I have been surviving off of what I can make driving for doordash , which hasn ' t been a lot .\n(6) Supporter: That is rough . The unemployment system has been very slow during COVID , so I completely understand your frustration and worry . I am glad to hear that you are doing door dash , even if you aren ' t making a lot that is still something ! [Affirmation and Reassurance]\n(7) Seeker: ugh , yeah . . .

When I started working from home I did a lot of research on different types of jobs that I could do from home . There are a lot of work options that are not necessarily well known , in my opinion , for online work . [Self-disclosure]\n(13) Seeker: Before this my work was primarily in concert audio , with a side hustle of carpentry . I ' ve been playing with these survey sites , and applying for a lot of call center jobs that don ' t seem interested in me . If you have any suggestions I ' m open to them !\n(14) Supporter: If you worked in audio I know that some places , like Upwork and ACX ( which does some audiobook work ) are looking for audio editing . I am sure that other places are looking for audio editing . I think Fiverr may also be a good place to advertise audio work . I also have an Etsy and Ebay shop , you could possibly sell some of your carpentry work on there if that is possible . Ebay is free to list and Etsy has a small listing fee .

[Greeting]\n(4) Seeker: I am glad you are doing well , I have been struggling lately as my girlfriend that I was going to propose to broke up with me . She told me that my career path was different then hers and she just did not see it working out .\n(5) Supporter: How was your career path different ? I understand how you are feeling everything will be okay . [Question]\n(6) Seeker: She had a desire to do marine biology and I wanted to pursue law enforcement as a police officer , however due to my back injury that fell through recently . She would spend most of her time doing field work , which would require her to spend time out at sea . She was working in a nursing home at the time and was not a marine biologist . .\n(7) Supporter: She did not like your career path ? [Question]\n(8) Seeker: I am thinking that would be the case , however we dated for 3 years and then reconnecting about a year later which at this time was a distant relationship . She now has a boyfriend which she started date about 2 months she broke up with me . I found out that he works with her at the nursing home . I am unsure what to think , but she did say that she just didn ' t see how our career paths would work out and that was that . .\n(9) Supporter: If anything she was supposed to support whatever career path you took and that is not right . It is weird to me also how she got into another relationship fast after she broke up with you just 2 months after . [Reflection of feelings]\n(10) Seeker: I have had some friends echo that . I agree , it definitely felt like I was giving a lot through the time we dated . I have always wondered if this was a true statement , knowing her I think she probably got scared of what that entailed or just the distance . The new boyfriend was definitely a wild card , that I think has caused me to question her parting words .\n(11) Supporter: Right but to be honest I would not let that stress you out or be upset about it because you do not need anybody that don ' t support your career . I would just move on and let it go and focus on your self . [Affirmation and Reassurance]\n(12) Seeker: I appreciate your feedback on this , ( this event for context occurred about a year ago and I have moved on from it ) my support system has said the same thing . I think the difficult part is just overcoming that mental / emotional hurdle of having the desire to marry her , which failed since it was an expectation of what was to come . I appreciate your suggestions . I think being the best \" me \" will help equip me for my future spouse ! : ) .\n(13) Supporter: Right i can understand how you are feeling . We all have been in a situation where we have the desire to marry someone and all that fails . I have been in a situation like that . [Self-disclosure]\n(14) Seeker: What did you do to help overcome the depression you faced or the grief of what was ? .\n(15) Supporter: I just had to let it go and just focus on myself because i had no choice . [Providing Suggestions or Information]\n(16) Seeker: That is a valid point , I appreciate your help with this situation and listening to what I experienced . .\n(17) Supporter: No problem . Merry Christmas ! [Greeting]\n(18) Seeker: Have a wonder Christmas , maybe we will chat again on this forum ! Happy Turking : )\n\nMotivation:\n",

I felt the same way until I made myself follow a strict studying regimen which helped a lot . [Self-disclosure]\n(6) Seeker: I see .

It sounds like you ' re really trying to help yourself grow . [Affirmation and Reassurance]\n(20) Seeker: Yes I hope so , because when I was younger , I used to be great at not being distracted so much in my studies and just bang it out real quick and well with my books . and all this is also worsened by the pandemic , I am afraid , of just not having a renewed from the indoor isolation . .\n(21) Supporter: yes , it ' s true people begin to struggle with focus as they reach young adulthood . I understand how you ' re feeling , COVID has affected me negatively as well but I ' m just trying to look at the bright side . [Providing Suggestions or Information]\n(22) Seeker: yes it has on us all . I guess the other thing is that my city has been doing fine so far , but just the past two weeks or so has been more and more cases , so just getting stressed and depressed with that and prospects of a second shut down . . so yes , the second wave is here it seems ( belatedly ) , but hopefully it doesn ' t get worse , because I have seen worse in other places right now .\n(23) Supporter: Yes , I would suggest taking up yoga or meditation to lessen the stress COVID has on your brain . [Providing Suggestions or Information]\n(24) Seeker: so I suppose just trying to cope with that also because I get nervous having to go out for work or errands , and I also have to write my exam outside of my home . . ok . I could look into that . I work out in general , but have been slacking off on those ever since the pandemic started this year . .\n(25) Supporter: Yes , I ' d recommend wearing a mask whenever you go out to lessen the chance of you contracting anything .

The struggle for money would still be an issue if I worked part - time . And I doubt I could find a better job at this particular time .

Any other suggestions ?\n(14) Supporter: We are going through some really tough times right now and I think that most people are very sympathetic . Especially for those who are in your shoes . Our children are our top priority and seeing them sick hurts us more than anything . How do you feel about talking to your boss about working in the office for a bit until things calm down a little ? Do you get paid vacation time in your job ? [Affirmation and Reassurance]\n(15) Seeker: That sounds like a reasonable thing to do . I do get paid vacation .\n\nMotivation:\n",

Live in central Kansas and have been very depressed .\n(2) Supporter: I ' m sorry to hear that , is there a particular reason or instance for you feeling this way ? [Question]\n(3) Seeker: I lost my job due to Covid and they have shut down for good . no jobs around here and no vehicle so i feel hopeless and hate my living situation . just before covid hit i was saving to move . . . but then job closed .\n(4) Supporter: Yes that is a very tough situation , Covid has real placed a large amount of stress through out the world . There may be a ray of hope however with a possible vaccine in the near future , maybe this will be back to normal soon and new jobs will become available . [Affirmation and Reassurance]\n(5) Seeker: I hope so and that is what i know mentally . but emotionally it is hard . i just hate having no job , being at home , no money , no vehicle , and a very bad idea to date since there is a high contagious pandemic .\n(6) Supporter: I understand and you are right it is a a lot of mental stress . Have you reached out to claim unemployment or go to a food pantry ? During this pandemic you should not feel shameful to take advantage of these services , there are alot of people who have to ask for help for the first time in their lives . [Affirmation and Reassurance]\n(7) Seeker: I did not make enough to get unemployment they said . I have not tried a food pantry but that is a great idea . what makes this difficult is I am in a very small town . like we dont wal marts or McDonalds or anything like that . Whole town closes at 9 . the closest actual city is 45 miles away .\n(8) Supporter: Well please try the food pantry and see what they have to offer . Is there anyone whom you could ask for a ride in the future when they go to the bigger city ?

Is there anything else you would like to talk about ? [Providing Suggestions or Information]\n(11) Seeker: Well I have been wanting a relationship . and i normally dont feel that way at all . and past week i think how much i kind of should have a family as I am 37 but not sure if i truly want that or i just miss human contact as i have only been around family and not gone out at all except to walk and go to store in town , and am confused if it is actully me wanting somone in my life or just a physical thing .\n(12) Supporter: I think your exactly right , human contact is now a premium and I ' m sure you miss that contact that we were once so use to . Missing the contact makes you realize how much you enjoy the company of others . Take it slow and once the vaccine is out ease your way back into the dating scene and see if a relationship is what you really wanted after all . [Providing Suggestions or Information]\n(13) Seeker: yeah i mean emotionally i want to go maybe try a date or two or even just an adult night out but know logically it is a VERY risky idea . And that I need to not do anything like that till next year at the minimum . I do appreciate the advice and ideas .\n(14) Supporter: Remember that age is only a number and love will no no number , we are hear to listen and support you so if you ever need to talk just know we are a mouse click away .
